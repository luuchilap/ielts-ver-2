## Routing Structure

```
/                    # Home page
/login              # Login page
/register           # Registration page
/dashboard          # Student dashboard
/tests              # Available tests listing
/tests/:id          # Test details page
/tests/:id/take     # Test taking interface
/results            # Results listing
/results/:id        # Detailed result view
/profile            # Profile settings
```

## State Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials
2. API call to backend
3. JWT token stored in localStorage
4. User data stored in AuthContext
5. Protected routes become accessible

### Test Taking Flow
1. User selects a test
2. Test data loaded from API
3. TestContext initialized with test state
4. Timer starts, progress tracking begins
5. Answers auto-saved every 30 seconds
6. Final submission to backend
7. Redirect to results page

## Data Types

### User Interface
```typescript
interface User {
  _id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  targetScore?: number;
  level?: 'Beginner' | 'Intermediate' | 'Advanced';
}
```

### Test Interface
```typescript
interface Test {
  _id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  difficulty: 'Beginner' | 'Intermediate' | 'Advanced';
  duration: number;
  skills: ('Reading' | 'Listening' | 'Writing' | 'Speaking')[];
  readingSections?: ReadingSection[];
  listeningSections?: ListeningSection[];
  writingTasks?: WritingTask[];
  speakingParts?: SpeakingPart[];
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- Lazy loading of route components
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Separate bundles for different features

### Caching Strategy
- React Query for API response caching
- Local storage for user preferences
- Service worker for offline functionality

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Minification and compression
- Asset optimization

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly interface
- Optimized audio controls
- Simplified navigation
- Reduced cognitive load

## Accessibility Features

- High contrast mode
- Focus management
- Alternative text for images

### Internationalization
- Support for multiple languages
- RTL text direction support
- Locale-specific formatting
- Cultural adaptations

## Development Workflow

```

### Environment Configuration
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_UPLOADS_URL=http://localhost:5000/uploads
REACT_APP_APP_NAME=IELTS Test Platform
```

## Integration with Admin System

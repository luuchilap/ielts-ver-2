I am using Windows OS (PowerShell), not Ubuntu or MacOS, so please provide instructions and code examples that are compatible with Windows PowerShell. Avoid using commands or scripts that are specific to Linux or MacOS environments, as they may not work in my setup. If you need to reference file paths or system commands, ensure they are formatted for Windows. Thank you!

Note that each time you run the command, you automatically turn on another terminnal window, so please ensure that the instructions are clear on how to manage multiple terminal windows effectively. This will help me avoid confusion and ensure a smooth workflow while using PowerShell for my tasks.

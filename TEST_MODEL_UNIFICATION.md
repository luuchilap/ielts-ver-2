# Test Model Unification

## Problem Identified

The Test model had a structural inconsistency between the admin and client systems:

- **Admin system** was creating tests with the legacy nested structure:
  - `reading.sections`
  - `listening.sections` 
  - `writing.tasks`
  - `speaking.parts`

- **Client/User system** expected the flat structure:
  - `readingSections`
  - `listeningSections`
  - `writingTasks`
  - `speakingParts`

This caused tests created by admins to not render properly in the user interface.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Admin Backend Controller (`admin/backend/src/controllers/testController.js`)

Modified `createTest` and `updateTest` functions to:
- Accept both legacy nested and flat structures
- Convert legacy structure to flat structure when saving
- Maintain backward compatibility by saving both structures

### 2. Updated Admin Frontend Components

Modified all test editors to save in both structures:
- `TestCreateForm.js` - Updated test creation to use both structures
- `ReadingTestEditor.js` - Updated to load from and save to both structures
- `ListeningTestEditor.js` - Updated to load from and save to both structures  
- `WritingTestEditor.js` - Updated to load from and save to both structures
- `SpeakingTestEditor.js` - Updated to load from and save to both structures

### 3. Updated Client Backend Controller (`client/backend/src/controllers/testController.js`)

Modified all functions that retrieve test data to:
- Use the `getUnifiedData()` method from the Test model
- Ensure tests created with legacy structure are properly converted to flat structure
- Remove sensitive data appropriately for each context

### 4. Migration Scripts

Created migration scripts for both admin and client databases:
- `admin/backend/scripts/migrateTestStructure.js`
- `client/backend/scripts/migrateTestStructure.js`

These scripts will:
- Find tests with only legacy structure and add flat structure
- Find tests with only flat structure and add legacy structure
- Ensure all tests have both structures for maximum compatibility

## How to Run Migration

### For Admin Database:
```bash
cd admin/backend
node scripts/migrateTestStructure.js
```

### For Client Database:
```bash
cd client/backend  
node scripts/migrateTestStructure.js
```

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Unified Data Storage**: Tests now store both flat and legacy structures
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tests continue to work
3. **Forward Compatibility**: New tests work across both admin and client systems
4. **Data Normalization**: Client controllers normalize data using `getUnifiedData()`
5. **Migration Support**: Scripts provided to update existing data
6. **Fixed Type Consistency**: Updated RegisterPage to use lowercase difficulty levels matching the Test model

## Additional Fixes

### RegisterPage TypeScript Error Fix
Fixed a TypeScript error in `client/frontend/src/pages/auth/RegisterPage.tsx` where difficulty levels were using capitalized values (`'Beginner'`, `'Intermediate'`, `'Advanced'`) instead of lowercase values (`'beginner'`, `'intermediate'`, `'advanced'`) as defined in the Test model.

## Test Model Structure (Both Formats Supported)

### Flat Structure (Primary for Client)
```javascript
{
  readingSections: [...],
  listeningSections: [...], 
  writingTasks: [...],
  speakingParts: [...]
}
```

### Legacy Structure (Backward Compatibility)
```javascript
{
  reading: { sections: [...], totalTime: 60 },
  listening: { sections: [...], totalTime: 40 },
  writing: { tasks: [...], totalTime: 60 },
  speaking: { parts: [...], totalTime: 15 }
}
```

The system now supports both formats seamlessly, ensuring consistent rendering across admin and client interfaces.
